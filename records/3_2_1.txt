start step 1: collect decision boundary points
start step 2: recover $\gamma_P$s
3 different MAPs occur
corresponding \gamma_P are: 
boundary point: 0, \gamma_p is [[-1.          0.16657429  5.09401211]]
boundary point: 1, \gamma_p is [[ 1.          0.89626764 -0.82813865]]
boundary point: 19, \gamma_p is [[1.         2.15661942 4.23046848]]
3  true MAPs are  [[1], [2], [3]]
We have collected all the required queries
