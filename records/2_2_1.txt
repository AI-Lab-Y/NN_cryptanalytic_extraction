when the recovered model is correct: 
expected w_1s are: 
[-1.         0.3851088]
[-1.         -2.43843857]
expected w_2 is: 
[-0.56514536 -0.43485464]
when we regard k-deep nn as a zero-deep nn: 
expected gamma_ps are: 
[ 1.        -0.3851088]

start step 1: collect decision boundary points
start step 2: recover $\gamma_P$s
3 different MAPs occur
corresponding \gamma_P are: 
boundary point: 0, \gamma_p is [[1.         0.84272386]]
boundary point: 1, \gamma_p is [[1.         2.43843864]]
boundary point: 5, \gamma_p is [[ 1.         -0.38510879]]
3  true MAPs are  [[3], [1], [2]]
We have collected all the required queries
the Oracle query times is 2**12.058668250340572
start recover nn under a subset of decision boundary points
we have found a solution
the model activation patterns of selected points are  [[1], [2], [3]]
selected w_2 sign is  1
